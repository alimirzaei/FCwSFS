# Fast Classification wih Sequential Feature Selection

This paper introduces a novel approach to active feature acquisition, which is the task of sequentially selecting the most informative subset of features to achieve optimal prediction performance during testing while minimizing cost. The proposed approach involves a new lazy model that is significantly faster and more efficient compared to existing methods, while still producing comparable accuracy results.
